# Summary of Cross-Region Inference Profile Implementation
# ======================================================

echo "‚úÖ CROSS-REGION INFERENCE PROFILE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED"
echo "==========================================================="

echo ""
echo "üìã CHANGES MADE:"
echo "---------------"

echo "1. üîß CloudFormation Template Updates:"
echo "   - Added comprehensive InferenceProfiles mapping for all major regions"
echo "   - Added environment variables for all Claude model inference profile ARNs"
echo "   - Updated IAM permissions to include inference-profile access"
echo "   - Supports US, EU, APAC, and Canada regions"

echo ""
echo "2. üêç Lambda Code Updates:"
echo "   - Enhanced MerakiAlertProcessor with inference profile support"
echo "   - Automatic detection of models requiring inference profiles"
echo "   - Graceful fallback from inference profile to direct invocation"
echo "   - Support for Claude 4, Claude 3.7, Claude 3.5, and Claude 3 models"

echo ""
echo "3. üß™ Testing Infrastructure:"
echo "   - Created test-inference-profile.py for comprehensive testing"
echo "   - Created test-lambda-inference.py for unit testing"
echo "   - Created quick-test-claude4.py for rapid validation"

echo ""
echo "4. üìö Documentation Updates:"
echo "   - Updated README.md with cross-region inference profile section"
echo "   - Added environment variable documentation"
echo "   - Added testing instructions"

echo ""
echo "üîç WHAT WAS FIXED:"
echo "-----------------"
echo "The original error:"
echo "\"Invocation of model ID anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0 with on-demand"
echo "throughput isn't supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of an"
echo "inference profile that contains this model.\""

echo ""
echo "Is now resolved by:"
echo "- Automatically using inference profile ARNs for Claude 4 and newer models"
echo "- Falling back to direct model IDs for older models or when profiles fail"
echo "- Regional mapping ensures correct profile ARNs are used"

echo ""
echo "üåç SUPPORTED REGIONS:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "- us-east-1, us-west-2 (US profiles)"
echo "- eu-west-1, eu-central-1 (EU profiles)"
echo "- ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-northeast-1, ap-south-1 (APAC profiles)"
echo "- ca-central-1 (US profiles)"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "1. Deploy using the existing deployment script:"
echo "   ./deploy-advanced.sh -s your-stack-name -r your-region"

echo ""
echo "2. Test the deployment:"
echo "   python3 test-inference-profile.py"

echo ""
echo "3. Verify webhook functionality:"
echo "   # Get API key (if enabled)"
echo '   API_KEY=$(./manage-api-key.sh get -s your-stack-name -r your-region)'
echo ""
echo "   # Test webhook"
echo '   curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \'
echo '   -d '"'"'{"alertType": "test", "organizationName": "Test Org"}'"'"' \'
echo '   "https://your-api-gateway-url/dev/webhook"'

echo ""
echo "‚ú® IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!"
echo "=========================="
echo "Your Lambda function now supports cross-region inference profiles"
echo "and will automatically handle Claude 4 and other modern models correctly."

echo ""
echo "üîó Files updated:"
echo "- cloudformation-template.yaml (inference profiles + environment variables)"
echo "- lambda.py (cross-region inference logic)"
echo "- README.md (documentation)"
echo "- test-*.py (testing infrastructure)"
