# Project Organization Update

## Changes Made

### ✅ README.md Updates

1. **Added Architecture Diagram**: 
   - Integrated `meraki-webhook-notification-diagram.jpeg` as the main architecture visualization
   - Replaced simple text diagram with professional diagram reference
   - Added detailed architecture flow description

2. **Added Project Structure Section**:
   - Clear file organization with descriptions
   - Core files explained with their purpose
   - Archive directory documented

3. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Added archived development tools section
   - Added contributing guidelines
   - Added support section
   - Improved overall structure and readability

### 🗂️ File Organization

**Archived to `archive/development-tools/`**:
- `test-inference-profile.py` - Comprehensive Bedrock testing
- `test-lambda-inference.py` - Unit testing framework
- `validate-inference-logic.py` - Logic validation without AWS calls
- `quick-test-claude4.py` - Quick Claude 4 testing
- `implementation-summary.sh` - Development summary
- `test-bedrock.sh` - Basic connectivity testing

**Cleaned Up**:
- Removed `__pycache__/` directory
- Organized remaining files for production use
